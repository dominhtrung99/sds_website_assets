Hazardous chemicals often can present a considerable risk for people and the environment.","image":"/images/articles/sds.jpg","content":"<p><p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever had an incident with chemicals before? One incident is enough to see the dangerous consequences of handling chemicals.</span></h2></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main issues working with chemicals is safety. Hazardous chemicals often can present a considerable risk for people and the environment. That is why Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are so important. They help personnel handling the chemicals know about the dangers and appropriate precautionary measures that need to be taken while working with these dangerous substances.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with the physical copies of SDS is fine, but it can present an issue when updated. Having them ready at hand at all times is much easier while working with online <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sdsmanager.com/us/search/\">SDS management systems</a>. Your employees will always have access to the latest SDS available with just a few clicks.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here we will present seven tips for using the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sdsmanager.com/us/search/\">SDS online</a>:</span></h2><ol><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Look for a good source</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should find a good source for SDS'. Look for a database that provides you with SDS of the highest quality. Safety data sheets must be provided in the local language and follow local/national regulatory requirements. SDS should be updated and in the correct format, and all that is left for you is to download them or use them.</span></p><ol start=\"2\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>SDS Compliance</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned previously, SDS need to be compliant with the local regulations. While the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) is implemented worldwide, every country has also implemented their unique tweaks regulating the safety data sheets. It is essential to know these differences, but it is even more important to train your employees on where to find the information that they are looking for.</span></p><ol start=\"3\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Correct format</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SDS' need to be formatted correctly. Otherwise, they're not compliant. And that could present an issue. It is necessary to select the suitable format for the right market to avoid paying the fines or penalties usually imposed by the legislation. Having a tool that can help you choose a suitable format can make a huge difference.</span></p><ol start=\"4\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Presentation of information</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many online <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sdsmanager.com/us/search/\">SDS databases</a> on the market, but you should look for one interface and how information is present that suits your business the most. It should be easy for any employee to use and search the database, but also the essential information should be presented intuitively.</span></p><ol start=\"5\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>SDS Inventory</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sdsmanager.com/us/search/\">online SDS tool</a> to help you set up the chemical inventory. This way, it will be easier to sort the information for any purpose. Be it the everyday work or regulatory reporting.</span></p><ol start=\"6\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>SDS Creation</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may not be a requirement fit for any business, but to the companies that need to have their own SDS, it should be of great help. Tools that can help you create a compliant SDS fast and high quality are worth it. It can help you save time for your employees to focus on other tasks and help you be compliant and not worry about fines and penalties.</span></p><ol start=\"7\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Exposure Scenarios</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some countries and markets, like the EU, for hazardous substances having the SDS and information from the SDS is not enough to fulfil the legal requirements for the safety of the chemical product. Businesses might also be obliged to attach Exposure Scenarios as an annexe to SDS.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exposure scenarios describe the operational conditions and risk management measures for adequate control of the risks to human health and the environment which might occur during the handling of the chemical product. You should look for a database that collects and provides information about exposure scenarios if you sell or formulate chemical products in specific markets like the EU.</span></p></p>","category":"ARTICLE","author":"Miljan","date":"January 07, 2022","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-tips-for-using-safety-data-sheets-online/"}},"allPostsJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"8cdc7e15-08fd-5d41-95da-b1b05610f8b1","title":"7 Life-Saving facts about the Importance of SDS Sheet","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"“SDS” Safety Data Sheet is a legal document that has all the hazard and risk details associated with the substance.","image":"/images/articles/Young-engineer-working-with-a.jpg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-life-saving-facts-about-the-importance-of-sds-sheet/"}}},{"node":{"id":"e3c7c402-0ce7-54f2-91b6-6b350d4b9999","title":"Understanding Safety Data Sheets","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"In the last couple of decades, regulations concerning chemicals or other dangerous substances have been rapidly developing around the globe.","image":"/images/articles/safety-data-sheets.jpeg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/understanding-safety-data-sheets/"}}},{"node":{"id":"43d83a9a-828a-5e16-b997-c036152d1a5d","title":"7 Reasons you need to take Safety Data Sheet Management seriously","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"Quality, environment and living organisms, especially human health safety, are the major concerns in the current era.","image":"/images/DefaultImage.png","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-reasons-you-need-to-take-safety-data-sheet-management-seriously/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"ed7cad9a-0944-5476-b897-ecb92b5d4a8e","slug":"/articles/7-tips-for-using-safety-data-sheets-online/","originalPath":"/articles/7-tips-for-using-safety-data-sheets-online/","lang":"en","dir":"en"}},
