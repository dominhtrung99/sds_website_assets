The desktop applications now feel robust and unnecessary in many cases since the most significant benefit of cloud-based solutions comes from &lsquo;&rsquo;shared accessibility&rsquo;&rsquo;. With the desktop applications, if needed in multiple places, it is necessary to install and update them on every computer where they are used. On the other hand, online software provides access to anyone with an internet connection. So, it is not surprising that even companies that have traditionally made desktop solutions are shifting more to the online solution models, for example, Microsoft with its online Office 365 solution.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One type of these online solutions is a software as a service (SaaS), a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is cloud-hosted.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SaaS is being used more and more often by big corporates for different business practices, and one of these is also Chemical Management. Using the monthly or annual subscription model, thousands and thousands of users access critical information for a lower cost than purchasing the traditional software. Not only that, but the cost-saving also comes in the form of less implementation and internal IT resources needs, more affordable licencing costs and less need for hardware purchase (e.g. internal storage servers). Using the SaaS cloud-based systems, companies should also have a much easier time with expense allocation, budgeting, and cost forecasting. Some companies offer licence per user, while others base their cost per product used or stored in the system. For the licencing cost, besides purchasing the rights to use the system, the user is also purchasing the service offered by the software provider for the data collection (e.g. SDSs or exposure scenarios). The software provider collects and imports the data in the system, updates it regularly, making it readily available for the user after the implementation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p><h2><strong><em>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) used for Chemical Inventory Management and Workplace Safety</em></strong></h2><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides the ease of access and implementation, one more benefit of using the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sdsmanager.com/us/search/\">online SaaS chemical management solutions</a> is the customisation and scalability of these solutions. Either whole or some parts of the system are usually customisable and adapted to the clients&rsquo; needs. Also, suppose the system has a modular approach. In that case, it is possible for customers only to purchase the functions and options relevant to the chemical management needs in their company and, with that, also cut the cost for the system. Depending on the provider, chemical management systems can be integrated with other systems in your company, for example, purchasing or CRM. This way, data could be shared between systems and different departments in the company. A barrier could be set so that the purchasing department needs to ask for permission from the production department before buying the chemical first. This way, it is easier to control new chemicals introduced in the company.</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These systems provide users with a plethora of options, helping them in their day to day work. Besides the collection and organisation of SDS&rsquo;, the solutions offer options for printing labels or creating chemical risk assessments and workplace instructions. Advanced systems also provide an option to export the information from the system in excel sheets for further data processing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting up the SaaS account is fast and straightforward. It helps companies focus more on their tasks by saving them time and money and compliance with the chemical legislation.</span></p></p>","category":"ARTICLE","author":"Miljan","date":"January 07, 2022","fields":{"slug":"/articles/how-to-use-a-software-as-a-service-saas-for-chemical-inventory-management-and-workplace-safety/"}},"allPostsJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"8cdc7e15-08fd-5d41-95da-b1b05610f8b1","title":"7 Life-Saving facts about the Importance of SDS Sheet","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"“SDS” Safety Data Sheet is a legal document that has all the hazard and risk details associated with the substance.","image":"/images/articles/Young-engineer-working-with-a.jpg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-life-saving-facts-about-the-importance-of-sds-sheet/"}}},{"node":{"id":"e3c7c402-0ce7-54f2-91b6-6b350d4b9999","title":"Understanding Safety Data Sheets","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"In the last couple of decades, regulations concerning chemicals or other dangerous substances have been rapidly developing around the globe.","image":"/images/articles/safety-data-sheets.jpeg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/understanding-safety-data-sheets/"}}},{"node":{"id":"43d83a9a-828a-5e16-b997-c036152d1a5d","title":"7 Reasons you need to take Safety Data Sheet Management seriously","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"Quality, environment and living organisms, especially human health safety, are the major concerns in the current era.","image":"/images/DefaultImage.png","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-reasons-you-need-to-take-safety-data-sheet-management-seriously/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"906a2b85-48c3-5e4a-b616-1da831f431dc","slug":"/articles/how-to-use-a-software-as-a-service-saas-for-chemical-inventory-management-and-workplace-safety/","originalPath":"/articles/how-to-use-a-software-as-a-service-saas-for-chemical-inventory-management-and-workplace-safety/","lang":"en","dir":"en"}},
