Not everybody knows how to conduct it efficiently. Learn more about the process and start substituting today.&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be able to perform a chemical substitution in an effective manner, it is helpful to learn more about the topic. By using a step by step method on how to substitute, it will become easier to begin the process of using less&nbsp;dangerous chemicals&nbsp;at your workplace. After testing this method, you will learn what works best for your company and how to establish a procedure that you and your colleagues can use.</span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong>Determine hazards and assess risks.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span>    </h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This step involves choosing whether the present product or process is a hazard. What products are on-site? Is there a substantial risk associated with storing, using, or taking care of a product? To answer these concerns, make sure to have a precise inventory of all products, as much information as possible regarding each product, including technical information, quantities, and life-cycle considerations (use, storage space, dealing with, transportation, and disposal). Identify if any of the products (or their active ingredients) are recognised on a regulative checklist as toxic, prohibited, toxic, etc. (for example, the Domestic Substance List under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act).</span></p><ol start=\"2\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong>Identifying alternatives</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span>    </h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explore a variety of alternatives. Compare every one of the hazard assessment information.</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will the substitute product satisfy the technical needs (e.g., solubility, drying out time, etc.)?</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compare the various states of a chemical (e.g., will a granular kind develop less dust than a powder type?).</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the product compatible with the process, various other products, or the equipment?</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the job needed or otherwise (e.g., can the part be changed rather than cleaned)?</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do existing control approaches properly regulate the substitute (e.g., a much less hazardous substitute may vaporise a lot more quickly, and the existing airflow system may not sufficiently capture the vapours)?</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will the existing waste disposal system meet technical and regulatory requirements when using the substitute when managing any new waste produced?</span></li></ul><ol start=\"3\"><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><strong>Complete the hazard assessment and think of what can occur if used alternatives.</strong>    </h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must gather all available and make a reasonable comparison of both the positive and negative points.</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Picking an alternative product may require changes in:</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The method the work is done,</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How and where the product will certainly be used,</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who will certainly be affected or revealed,</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount utilised,</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sort of equipment or components (e.g., O-rings, gaskets, or hose materials) required to be compatible with the substitute,</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The airflow system that may be required,</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The disposal methods and regulatory requirements that may be used.</span></li></ul><ol start=\"4\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong>Comparing options.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>    </h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this action, compare the various other choices and the substance or process presently being used. It can be difficult to compare the risks of one eruptive chemical with a very harmful one. Think of the impacts in basic terms, such as \"Is the substitute most likely to take off or toxin people? Will it just affect people who work with it, or could it impact other individuals in the location?\" Bear in mind to consider exactly how and where the choice will be used.</span></p><ol start=\"5\"><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong>Choosing whether to substitute.</strong>    </h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, it is good to introduce the substitute on a trial or small quantity basis.
