Retail distributors must provide, upon request, material safety data sheets to commercial customers and post a sign or otherwise inform them that a material safety data sheet is available. This provision of the HCS was included to prevent the necessity of providing a sheet to each customer of a retail establishment in order to ensure that employers received a material safety data sheet. Your constituent is not required to provide material safety data sheets to retail distributors that have informed him that they do not sell the product to commercial customers or open the sealed container to use it in their own workplaces. </span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1989-03-03\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[3]</span></a></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The requirement to provide material safety data sheets (MSDSs) to employers who buy their hazardous chemicals from a retail outlet and who request an MSDS for the purchased chemical is a requirement of the standard for these types of distributors if they are transmitting hazardous chemicals to downstream employers. As mentioned in the preamble to the 1987 final rule on Hazard Communication (FR&nbsp;Vol. 52, No. 163, page 31866): \"retail distributors will have to assess their product lines, and whether or not they have commercial accounts, to determine whether they must comply with this provision.\" </span><a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1994-09-28\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[2]</span></a></p><h2><strong>Standard: 1910.1200(g)(7)(iii)</strong></h2><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retail distributors selling hazardous chemicals to employers having a commercial account shall provide a material safety data sheet to such employers upon request and post a sign or otherwise inform them that a material safety data sheet is available.
