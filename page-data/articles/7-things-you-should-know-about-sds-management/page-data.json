These hard copies had to be continually replaced whenever a new or revised SDS appeared. Today, technology gives us the possibility to optimise this process.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the seven things you should know about SDS management and how to be compliant:</span></h2><ol><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Provide universal access</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone who works with hazardous chemicals has to have access to the SDS at all times. By using online platforms, workers should quickly log in via their phone or computer and access this information.</span></p><ol start=\"2\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Educate your employees</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today's SDS' are standardised documents with 16 sections. Each section contains specific safety information. Employees should know what the SDS is, its format and how to read and find the information they are looking for.</span></p><ol start=\"3\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Improve internal procedures</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SDS system should help you improve your procedures. Each company should establish their internal standards for handling chemicals and related documentation.</span></p><ol start=\"4\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Keep the archive</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some countries, legislation prescribes a 10-year period by which the relevant documentation (including SDS) should be saved and archived. If your SDS gets updated today, the previous version should be saved for the next ten years.</span></p><ol start=\"5\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Have a back-up</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you access the information in case of a power outage? Develop backup plans in case of emergency.</span></p><ol start=\"6\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Communicate better</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main goals of the SDS system is to improve communication within the company. Share the data, make and print out documentation and establish a line of communication between all workers at risk.</span></p><ol start=\"7\"><li aria-level=\"1\">    <h3><strong><em>Disposal considerations</em></strong></h3></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the SDS, you can find information on the proper methods for the disposal of waste products and packaging. Inform the workers, so they have the knowledge and tools for proper disposal.</span></p></p>","category":"ARTICLE","author":"Miljan","date":"January 07, 2022","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-things-you-should-know-about-sds-management/"}},"allPostsJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"8cdc7e15-08fd-5d41-95da-b1b05610f8b1","title":"7 Life-Saving facts about the Importance of SDS Sheet","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"“SDS” Safety Data Sheet is a legal document that has all the hazard and risk details associated with the substance.","image":"/images/articles/Young-engineer-working-with-a.jpg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-life-saving-facts-about-the-importance-of-sds-sheet/"}}},{"node":{"id":"e3c7c402-0ce7-54f2-91b6-6b350d4b9999","title":"Understanding Safety Data Sheets","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"In the last couple of decades, regulations concerning chemicals or other dangerous substances have been rapidly developing around the globe.","image":"/images/articles/safety-data-sheets.jpeg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/understanding-safety-data-sheets/"}}},{"node":{"id":"43d83a9a-828a-5e16-b997-c036152d1a5d","title":"7 Reasons you need to take Safety Data Sheet Management seriously","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"Quality, environment and living organisms, especially human health safety, are the major concerns in the current era.","image":"/images/DefaultImage.png","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-reasons-you-need-to-take-safety-data-sheet-management-seriously/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"4c0c974e-bb6d-5a6e-99b1-82394523f7d3","slug":"/articles/7-things-you-should-know-about-sds-management/","originalPath":"/articles/7-things-you-should-know-about-sds-management/","lang":"en","dir":"en"}},
