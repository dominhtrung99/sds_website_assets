LHAT helps with&nbsp;the identification of hazards and&nbsp;determines the Individual Protective Tools&nbsp;(PPE) to be used during the&nbsp;defined job activities. All personnel handling chemicals are required to wear. At a minimum, this consists of pants and also closed-toe shoes, chemically resistant gloves, a research coat, and also eye protection.&nbsp;</span></h2><p>    <h3><strong>Use Common PPEs while working with Chemicals:</strong></h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From extreme chemical burns to deterioration&nbsp;of the skin and skin cancer, protecting the skin is essential&nbsp;to workers&rsquo; safety. Coveralls with hoods or other full-body protective&nbsp;fits are usually utilised for body security, and chemical-resistant&nbsp;gloves will protect the arms, hands, and fingers from&nbsp;dangerous materials and skin absorption.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A worker's eyes are also at risk of chemical hazards, and direct&nbsp;exposure or contact can cause&nbsp;irreversible eye damages&nbsp;and even loss of vision. Safety goggles will&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;protect a worker from acids, chemical gases, vapours, and it is especially&nbsp;vital to maintain liquid chemicals for spraying right&nbsp;into the eye. Face shields are&nbsp;an excellent alternative for particularly&nbsp;dangerous chemicals that are at risk for&nbsp;misting or sprinkling onto the face.</span></p><p><strong><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"/images/articles/Post10A.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></strong></p><p>    <h3><strong>Appropriate gloves choice:</strong></h3><strong><br /></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When dealing with hazardous chemicals, pick gloves that provide ample defence to the chemical hazards.
