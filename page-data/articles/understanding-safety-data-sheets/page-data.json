Regulations prescribe several different obligations and requirements for the safe handling of chemicals. One of such obligations is a requirement for safety data sheets. While there are some differences between different regions and markets, it is an almost universal requirement today that businesses that handle hazardous chemicals should provide their employees and customers with safety data sheets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article will explore everything you need to know about the safety data sheets and their contents.</span></p><h2><strong>So, what exactly are Safety Data Sheets?</strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the name suggests, Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is a document designed to provide persons who handle chemicals with relevant safety information. Whether you use, store, sell or handle hazardous chemicals in any other way, you should have an SDS at hand. Additionally, SDS should be presented to emergency personnel to help them perform better and improve their efficiency.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main goals of the SDS is the reduction of risks associated with the handling of chemical products. It should help personnel protect themselves from exposure, hazards, or accidents while handling the chemical product. SDS should contain information about the preventive measures which need to be followed while working with the chemical product.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SDS is not primarily intended for use by the general consumer. But if the product is sold directly to the consumer, a seller might have the obligation of providing the consumer with the SDS in some countries.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, most countries worldwide follow the </span><a href=\"http://unece.org/about-ghs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #000ed1;\">Globally Harmonized System for the classification and labelling of chemicals (GHS</span>)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is implemented in some way in their local chemical management frameworks. Among other things, GHS prescribes SDS requirements, including its content and format.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides information concerning the identification of the chemical product and its supplier and label information, SDS should include information on:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- the instructions for the safe use and handling of chemical product&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- potential hazards associated with the product and its components</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- first aid measures</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- measures in case of fire or accidents&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- personal protective equipment and exposure control&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- physical and chemical properties of the product, including chemical stability and reactivity</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- toxicological and ecotoxicological effects</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- disposal of waste</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- requirements concerning the transportation of hazardous chemicals and regulations associated with the chemical product</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information mentioned above should be arranged in the 16 sections prescribed by the GHS.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standard SDS made according to GHS rules should consist of the following 16 sections:</span></p><h3><strong><em>SECTION 1: Identification of the substance/mixture and the company/undertaking</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 2: Hazards identification</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 3: Composition/information on ingredients</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 4: First aid measures</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 5: Firefighting measures</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 6: Accidental release measure</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 7: Handling and storage</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 8: Exposure controls/personal protection</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 9: Physical and chemical properties</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 10: Stability and reactivity</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 11: Toxicological information</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 12: Ecological information</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 13: Disposal considerations</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 14: Transport information</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 15: Regulatory information</em></strong></h3><h3><strong><em>SECTION 16: Other information</em></strong></h3><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that the GHS presents a basis for the harmonisation of rules and regulations on chemicals at the international level. Still, countries may also choose to adopt only parts of the GHS. GHS has been introduced to many countries/regions such as Europe, the US, Canada, Russia, China, Japan, Korea, etc., via their own legislation or standards. It divides chemical hazards into three main groups:</span></p><h2><strong><em>Physical hazards</em></strong></h2><h2><strong><em>Health hazards</em></strong></h2><h2><strong><em>Environmental hazards.</em></strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some countries haven't adopted chapters for environmental hazards classification and labelling like the US. This is why only following GHS is not enough. Local legislation also needs to be checked.</span></p></p>","category":"ARTICLE","author":"Miljan","date":"January 07, 2022","fields":{"slug":"/articles/understanding-safety-data-sheets/"}},"allPostsJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"8cdc7e15-08fd-5d41-95da-b1b05610f8b1","title":"7 Life-Saving facts about the Importance of SDS Sheet","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"“SDS” Safety Data Sheet is a legal document that has all the hazard and risk details associated with the substance.","image":"/images/articles/Young-engineer-working-with-a.jpg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-life-saving-facts-about-the-importance-of-sds-sheet/"}}},{"node":{"id":"e3c7c402-0ce7-54f2-91b6-6b350d4b9999","title":"Understanding Safety Data Sheets","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"In the last couple of decades, regulations concerning chemicals or other dangerous substances have been rapidly developing around the globe.","image":"/images/articles/safety-data-sheets.jpeg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/understanding-safety-data-sheets/"}}},{"node":{"id":"43d83a9a-828a-5e16-b997-c036152d1a5d","title":"7 Reasons you need to take Safety Data Sheet Management seriously","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"Quality, environment and living organisms, especially human health safety, are the major concerns in the current era.","image":"/images/DefaultImage.png","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-reasons-you-need-to-take-safety-data-sheet-management-seriously/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e3c7c402-0ce7-54f2-91b6-6b350d4b9999","slug":"/articles/understanding-safety-data-sheets/","originalPath":"/articles/understanding-safety-data-sheets/","lang":"en","dir":"en"}},
