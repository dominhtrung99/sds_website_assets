Employers must adhere to all appropriate OSHA standards. They need to&nbsp;also comply with the General&nbsp;work&nbsp;Clause of the OSH Act, which requires employers to keep their workplace&nbsp;without seriously acknowledged hazards.</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On December 29, 1970, OSHA was established on the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act). Coupled with the efforts of employers, workers, health and safety experts, advocates and unions, OSHA and its state partners have significantly improved workplace safety, lowering work-related fatalities by practically 63 per cent. In 1970, an estimated 14,000 workers were killed on the worksite every year. In 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics report's subject number fell to 5,250 or about 14 workers per day. At the same time, U.S. employment has more than doubled to over 146 million workers at more than 10 million workplaces. The rate of severe workplace injuries and diseases reported has also dropped noticeably, from 11/100 workers in 1972 to 3/ 100 workers in 2018.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSHA's safety and health requirements,&nbsp;including asbestos, fall&nbsp;defence, cotton dust, trenching, machine protecting, lead, benzene,&nbsp;and bloodborne pathogens, have prevented&nbsp;many job-related injuries, health problems, and fatalities. Significant risks and risky&nbsp;conditions still exist in U.S.&nbsp;offices;&nbsp;each year, more than 3.5 million working&nbsp;guys and women suffer a severe job-related injury or disease.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the direct influence on specific workers, the unfavourable repercussions for America's economy are significant.&nbsp;Occupational injuries and illnesses cost American&nbsp;companies&nbsp;more than $97.4 billion a year in workers'&nbsp;settlement expenses alone. Indirect costs to companies, including lost performance, worker&nbsp;training and replacement costs, and time for investigations following injuries, can more than double these&nbsp;expenses.&nbsp;Workers and their families suffer&nbsp;excellent emotional and mental&nbsp;costs, in addition to the loss of&nbsp;earnings and the costs of taking care of the injured, which even more deteriorates the economy.</span></p><p>    <h2><strong>OSHA Covers:</strong></h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSHA Coverage The OSH Act covers most private sector companies and their workers, in addition to some public sector employers and workers in the 50 states and certain areas and jurisdictions under federal authority.</span></h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSHA determines all the&nbsp;standards apply at&nbsp;your&nbsp;workplace and requires you to follow&nbsp;the standard and requirements.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OSHA covers all employees and their employers under Federal Government authority.

These are typically classified according to their risk to health and property. Hazardous chemicals are categorised as follows:</span></p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong><em>Explosive or flammable</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;(e.g. petroleum, TNT, plastic explosives)</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong><em>Corrosive or Irritating</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to skin, lungs, and eyes&nbsp;(e.g. acids, fumes, paints, alkali)</span></li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong><em>Toxic chemicals</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;(e.g. hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, cyanide)</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Severe&nbsp;cautions are to be taken when&nbsp;dealing with, keeping, transporting, and using dangerous&nbsp;chemicals.

Depending&nbsp;upon the substances, this may&nbsp;involve rubber gloves, safety goggles, chemical-resistant coveralls, or&nbsp;respirators.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harmful&nbsp;chemicals are accompanied by Safety Data Sheets (SDS) that&nbsp;detail the seriousness of the prospective dangers and the precaution that should be in location when handling these substances.</span></p></p>","category":"ARTICLE","author":"Rashid","date":"January 07, 2022","fields":{"slug":"/articles/all-you-need-to-know-about-osha-workplace-chemical-hazards/"}},"allPostsJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"8cdc7e15-08fd-5d41-95da-b1b05610f8b1","title":"7 Life-Saving facts about the Importance of SDS Sheet","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"“SDS” Safety Data Sheet is a legal document that has all the hazard and risk details associated with the substance.","image":"/images/articles/Young-engineer-working-with-a.jpg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-life-saving-facts-about-the-importance-of-sds-sheet/"}}},{"node":{"id":"e3c7c402-0ce7-54f2-91b6-6b350d4b9999","title":"Understanding Safety Data Sheets","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"In the last couple of decades, regulations concerning chemicals or other dangerous substances have been rapidly developing around the globe.","image":"/images/articles/safety-data-sheets.jpeg","fields":{"slug":"/articles/understanding-safety-data-sheets/"}}},{"node":{"id":"43d83a9a-828a-5e16-b997-c036152d1a5d","title":"7 Reasons you need to take Safety Data Sheet Management seriously","date":"2022-01-07","excerpt":"Quality, environment and living organisms, especially human health safety, are the major concerns in the current era.","image":"/images/DefaultImage.png","fields":{"slug":"/articles/7-reasons-you-need-to-take-safety-data-sheet-management-seriously/"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"67034be5-2c06-57f9-8360-4df7b0a84933","slug":"/articles/all-you-need-to-know-about-osha-workplace-chemical-hazards/","originalPath":"/articles/all-you-need-to-know-about-osha-workplace-chemical-hazards/","lang":"en","dir":"en"}},
